to learn more about contribution read further. contribution guidelinesto contribute to athena first of all please have a look at contribution guidelines which can be found hereathena framework  contribution guidelineshttpsgithub.comstuykaltvathenablobmastercontributing.md contribution philosophycontributing to the athena framework follows a very specific philosophy.when you want to contribute new features code or introduce something new to the core of the athena framework you need to consider the following. is the feature that has been written something that all developers who are using athena can utilizehere are a few examples of what could ben written instead of writing a feature directly. you wrote a new skill into athena that lets you level your strength.     instead you can write a skill system that lets you build custom skills that other developers can tap into to build plugins based on your skill system.br  you wrote an lspd faction     instead you write a faction system that is utilized by all factions and then developers can build their own factions with similar features.br  you wrote a job specifically to revive civilians     instead you should write a job system that lets others build jobs easily that are designated for player interactions.what makes athena easy to use is that we introduce features that let you build out more complex systems quickly without having to figure out the hidden complexities of that system.we want developers building on top of athena to have very fast turn around times for new features. about contributingso the idea behind contribution is basically that you have a feature branch in your own private repository of athena.youll need to test features you want to pull first locally also you will need to bring the changes to your own custom repository first.this is usually done through the usage of git.you will find examples in here of how its done through the terminal in visual studio code powershell or gitbash. fork a repositoryto fork a repository youll need to go to the url of the repository you want to fork. afterwards you can press the fork button in the upper right.heres an example of how it will look likeimagehttpsi.imgur.comazuyokd.png switch branchessince athena is always based on the latest devbranch you should have an idea of how to switch branches.basically branches can be switched by tsgit checkout branchname  basic examplegit checkout 3.9.0  more real examplethis requires you to have an fetched upstream with available branches. create feature branchi would highly suggest that you learn to use feature branches for public contribution. here is an example of how it is done.a new branch is always inherited from the current branch you are working on. so if you are using the master branch your feature branch will also inherit from the master branch.tsgit checkout b branchname  basic examplegit checkout b hacktober  more real example  will immediately checkout to new

you how the author organized the project structure. single resourceunlike in fivem or other platforms the athena framework runs out of a single resource using the altv client. which means that there is no resource restarting. instead its a full server restart.you may think but thats really slow isnt it thats what i originally thought when i started writing this project but by using the most

athena.athena framework folder in vscodehttpsi.imgur.compjhquy2.png server structure explainedif you are planning on modifying these folders they are highly likely to be modified in the future. if you want to expand upon the framework consider using plugins.  apithis folder contains the core api. its mostly only useful for adding new functions to the athena api in groups.  athenathere is a configuration file inside of here for customizing some of the core game modes features. its currently being phased out but some configuration data is still present. decoratorsall existing typescript based decorates for the framework. effectsthese are the default item effects that come with the athena framework. there isnt very many in here but enough information to build your own item effects.  eventsthese are mostly event structures to help make athena tick. they should remain mostly untouched as there isnt much to customize here.  extensionsthis is where player functionality currently lives. they can usually be accessed through athena.player.x or athena.vehicle.x inside of vscode when writing functions.extensions can usually be modified with an override function to change the behavior and logic. which is accessible through the plugin structure as well.  importsthis is where all core game mode imports are done. these usually consist of many different imports with a load order to ensure the game mode runs correctly. you may append any additional core import files here. however it is highly recommended to use the plugin structure instead for modifying  adding new features to the framework.creatingplugins.md....pluginscreatingplugins.md  interfacethese are serverside specific interfaces which help define different type structures in the framework. you can find account structure category information configs etc. in here. usually you dont want to directly modify these but instead extend them. you can find examples of extensions of common interfaces inside of some of the plugins in the srccoreplugins folder.  streamersthese help synchronize server and client specific information using a custom node based streamer that runs alongside the athena framework. the streamer basically takes in player information determines the closest set of data around that player then feeds it to the players clientside.in most cases all major streamers are covered such as objects markers static pedestrians text labels etc.these can be accessed under athena.controllers.x  systemsthis is a huge portion of the logic for the framework. this is where a lot of core functionality can be found. everything from sound systems character systems blip systems chat systems storage systems can all be found here.this also contains injections which can be accessed through athena.injections. injections will let you override or modify existing features without touching the core too much.the catch is that the functionality in most of this section is abstracted to be used
